<h2>How to prevent pollution</h2>

<p>
1)Conserve energy - at home, at work, everywhere.<br>
2)Look for the ENERGY STAR label when buying home or office equipment.<br>
3)Carpool, use public transportation, bike, or walk whenever possible.<br>
4)Follow gasoline refueling instructions for efficient vapor recovery, being careful not to spill fuel and always tightening your gas cap securely.<br>
5)Consider purchasing portable gasoline containers labeled “spill-proof,” where available.<br>
6)Keep car, boat, and other engines properly tuned.<br>
7)Be sure your tires are properly inflated.<br>
8)Use environmentally safe paints and cleaning products whenever possible.<br>
9)Mulch or compost leaves and yard waste.<br>
10)Consider using gas logs instead of wood.<br>

<h2> Plant and save trees</h2>
<figure><img width="700px" height="500px" src="https://treefoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PIXNIO-13906-2500x1666-1-1536x1024.jpg" style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;"><br><figcaption style="text-align: center;"></figcaption> </figure>
<h3>1. Conserve trees and forests in your area.</h3>
<figure><img width="700px" height="500px" src="https://treefoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PIXNIO-13906-2500x1666-1-1536x1024.jpg" style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;"><br><figcaption style="text-align: center;"></figcaption> </figure>
<p>Forests and trees—especially big trees and mature forests—have many benefits. They provide habitat for a multitude of species, store carbon, maintain water quality, stabilize the climate, and provide places for people to recreate and connect with nature. Encourage your local government to conserve forests, create parks, and oppose destructive suburban sprawl and other developments. Volunteer with a local land trust or parks and recreation department, or consider a conservation easement if you own forested land. </p>
<h3>2. Plant trees—the more the better. <br></h3>
<figure><img width="700px" height="500px" src="https://treefoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/TREE-long-logo.png" style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;"><br><figcaption style="text-align: center;"></figcaption> </figure>
<p>Reforestation is a critical part of the solution to climate change, and restoring previously degraded ecosystems provides essential habitat for threatened species. Plant trees in your community or donate to organizations that plant trees around the world. Keep in mind that planting trees should never be an excuse for destroying existing forests and, when you donate, make sure that your money goes toward restoring native ecosystems rather than planting timber monocultures destined for logging.</p>
<h3>3. Support forest conservation organizations.<br></h3>

<p>NGOs like the TREE Foundation, the Nature Conservancy, the Sierra Club, Center for Biological Diversity, and Rainforest Action Network offset deforestation and conserve threatened ecosystems around the world. In the absence of effective and environmentally-friendly governance in many areas, NGOs provide important organizational and monetary support for a variety of conservation efforts. Find a reputable conservation charity that speaks to you and send them a tax-deductible donation. Or find a local forest nonprofit and volunteer!</p>
<h3>4. Learn about forests, both local and global.<br></h3>

<p>Educate yourself about forests, their importance, and the threats they face. The more you learn about these wonderful ecosystems, the more you can appreciate their beauty, complexity, and critical role in our planet’s health. With your newfound knowledge, you can also inspire others to take action! There are many excellent books, websites, and documentaries out there to explore. </p>
<h3>5.Buy forest-friendly (or certified) products such as shade-grown coffee.</h3>
<figure><img width="700px" height="500px" src="https://treefoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pexels-photo-2880428-1536x1025.jpeg" style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;"><br><figcaption style="text-align: center;"></figcaption> </figure>
<p>Use your purchasing power in a high-impact way to prevent deforestation. Agriculture is responsible for 80 percent of deforestation around the world, with mining and logging contributing as well. Beef is by far the worst offender—in addition to driving widespread forest clearing in the tropics, cows contribute heavily to climate change by emitting methane. Avoid buying beef, soy, uncertified palm oil or other products that come from the tropics, and look for certifications from the Rainforest Alliance, Forest Stewardship Council, and the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil when you shop. Food co-ops and natural food stores often carry these products. Buy shade-grown coffee, which is grown under the forest canopy rather than on cleared lands.</p>
<h3>6.Demand better labeling of products so you know if they are certified and sustainable.</h3>
<figure><img width="700px" height="500px" src="https://treefoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Webp.net-resizeimage-1-1536x1152.jpg" style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;"><br><figcaption style="text-align: center;"></figcaption> </figure>
<p>Although certifications can give consumers valuable information about the environmental impacts of the products they are buying, the vast majority of products are not certified and many stores do not carry certified products. Demand that your local retailers carry certified products, educate them about why this matters, and call them out if they sell products that result in deforestation. Contact the major food companies you buy from and insist they use sustainable products. Create campaigns that pressure companies to increase transparency in their supply chains and switch to sustainable sourcing for their products.</p>

	<p>1)Keeping the tap closed when not in use.<br>
2)Check for the openings or leaks in water distribution pipes.<br>
3)Make sure to use collected rainwater for gardening or washing purpose.<br>
4)Always have a measure of how many buckets of water is wasted in a day and try to reduce.<br>
5)Do not run more water than necessary while washing and cleaning clothes, utensils, etc.<br>
6)Do not prolong your bathing. Go for a quick shower rather than wasting buckets of water<br>
7)Rainwater harvesting is one of the best method used for conserving water. There are different methods used to preserve rainwater instead of getting it wasted.<br>
