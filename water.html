<h1>WATER scarcity</h1>

<h2> Water</h2>
<p>Water scarcity (water stress or water crisis) is the lack of fresh water resources to meet the standard water demand. Humanity is facing a water crisis, due to unequal distribution (exacerbated by climate change) resulting in some very wet and some very dry geographic locations, plus a sharp rise in global freshwater demand in recent decades driven by industry. Water scarcity can also be caused by droughts, lack of rainfall, or pollution. This was listed in 2019 by the World Economic Forum as one of the largest global risks in terms of potential impact over the next decade. It is manifested by partial or no satisfaction of expressed demand, economic competition for water quantity or quality, disputes between users, irreversible depletion of groundwater, and negative impacts on the environment.[2] Two-thirds of the global population (4 billion people) live under conditions of severe water scarcity at least 1 month of the year.Half a billion people in the world face severe water scarcity all year round. Half of the world's largest cities experience water scarcity.

The essence of global water scarcity is the geographic and temporal mismatch between fresh water demand and availability. The increasing world population, improving living standards, changing consumption patterns, and expansion of irrigated agriculture are the main driving forces for the rising global demand for water.[9][10] Climate change, such as altered weather-patterns (including droughts or floods), deforestation, increased pollution, green house gases, and wasteful use of water can cause insufficient supply. At the global level and on an annual basis, enough freshwater is available to meet such demand, but spatial and temporal variations of water demand and availability are large, leading to (physical) water scarcity in several parts of the world during specific times of the year. Scarcity varies over time as a result of natural hydrological variability, but varies even more so as a function of prevailing economic policy, planning and management approaches. Scarcity can be expected to intensify with most forms of economic development, but, if correctly identified, many of its causes can be predicted, avoided or mitigated.</p>

<h2>Importance of water </h2>
<p>It is most important that the water which people drink and use for other purposes is clean water. This means that the water must be free of germs and chemicals and be clear (not cloudy).

Water that is safe for drinking is called potable water.

Disease-causing germs and chemicals can find their way into water supplies. When this happens the water becomes polluted or contaminated and when people drink it or come in contact with it in other ways they can become very sick.

Water that is not safe to drink is said to be non-potable. Throughout history there have been many occasions when hundreds of thousands of people have died because disease-causing germs have been spread through a community by a polluted water supply.

One of the reasons this happens less frequently now is that people in many countries make sure drinking water supplies are potable. Water supplies are routinely checked for germs and chemicals which can pollute water. If the water is not safe to drink it is treated. All the action taken to make sure that drinking water is potable is called water treatment.</p>

<p>Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth.
Only run the washing machine and dishwasher when you have a full load.
Use a low flow shower head and faucet aerators.
Fix leaks.
Install a dual flush or low flow toilet or put a conversion kit on your existing toilet.
Donâ€™t overwater your lawn or water during peak periods, and install rain sensors on irrigation systems.
Install a rain barrel for outdoor watering.
Plant a rain garden for catching stormwater runoff from your roof, driveway, and other hard surfaces.
Monitor your water usage on your water bill and ask your local government about a home water audit.
Share your knowledge about saving water through conservation and efficiency with your neighbors.

<h1>Intiative taken by the government </h1>
<p>1. In Punjab, drainage lines are being fixed to avoid the problem of waterlogging.<br>
2. In Telengana's Thimayapalli, construction of tanks is changing the lives of the villagers.<br>
3. In Rajasthan, people have created small ponds in the farms which have brought a lot of change to the people.<br>
4. In Vellore, Tamil Nadu, 20 thousand women came together to revive Naga river.</p>
